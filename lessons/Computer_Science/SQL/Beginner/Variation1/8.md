Sometimes it's nice to order the rows in a specific way.  For instance to order people by age, we could say:

    select first_name from people order by age

You can also use "order by" on words, which will sort them alphabetically.

# Question
How do we get a list of everyone's first names, sorted alphabetically?

# Answer
select first_name from people order by first_name

# Explanation
Here we use "order by" on the first_name column and select the same column to get an alphabetical listing of first names.
