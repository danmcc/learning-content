# Discussion

Often when we're testing queries, we want to just return the first few rows.  You can do this by using a "limit" clause:

    select * from people limit 2

Here, "*" is used to mean "select all columns in the table."  The result looks like this:

| id | first_name | age | country |
|----|------------|-----|---------|
| 1  | Felipe     | 17  | Peru    |
| 2  | Sergei     | 22  | Russia  |

# Question
How do we get the first name of the youngest person in the table without using "min"?

# Answer
select age from people order by age limit 1

# Explanation
We combine a "limit" clause with an "order by" clause to get all the people in the table ordered by age, while only returning the first row.
