# Discussion

The "group by" statement can be used to group rows together.  This is often used with "count", "avg", "min", and "max".
For instance, to count the number of people in each country, we would write:

    select count(*), country from people group by country

This would return a result like this:

| count(*) | country |
|----------|---------|
| 1        | Peru    |
| 2        | Russia  |
| 1        | Italy   |
| 1        | China   |
