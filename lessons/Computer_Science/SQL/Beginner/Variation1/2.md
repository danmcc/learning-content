# Discussion

To ask questions like "{{previous question}}?”, we use a language called Structured Query Language or SQL.  You’d ask that particular question by writing:

    select first_name from people where id={{previous question placeholder 1}}

# Question
How would you write the SQL to get the last name of the person with an id of {{3,4,5}}?

# Answer
select last_name from people where id={{3,4,5}}

# Explanation
To find the last name, we select the field "last_name" with an id of the row with the name we’re looking for.
