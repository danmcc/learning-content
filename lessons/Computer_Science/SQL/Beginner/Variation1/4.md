# Discussion

You can also select multiple rows from a table.  For instance, to get the first names of all the people in Russia, you could write:

    select first_name from people where country="Russia"

This would return a result that looked like this:

| first_name |
|------------|
| Sergei     |
| Nicolas    |

# Question

How would you write the SQL to get the first name of everyone who is older than 18?

# Answer

select * from people where age > 18

# Explanation

In addition to the "=" sign, you can use these signs to select more than one row: < (less than), > (greater than),
<= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), <> (not equal to).
